# ðŸ’¬ðŸ¦™ Chat with Snowflake's Wikipedia page, powered by LlamaIndex

Build a chatbot powered by LlamaIndex that augments GPT 3.5 with the contents of Snowflake's Wikipedia page (or your own data).

## Overview of the App

<img src="app.png" width="75%">

- Takes user queries via Streamlit's `st.chat_input` and displays both user queries and model responses with `st.chat_message`
- Uses LlamaIndex to load and index data and create a chat engine that will retrieve context from that data to respond to each user query
